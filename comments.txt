29-There are a lot of ways to make a union work. No, it doesn't make sense to be like the B&amp;T unions in your city that pay strictly by years of seniority, but that's not the only way for unions to function. You could easily have a union that sets only minimum pay rules, or something more akin to any of the various licensure organizations that exist for other learned professions like lawyers, engineers, or accountants (which aren't "unions" but do many of the same things as unions, including regulating work hours and conditions).-0.3833257-0.2849125-0.3224644-1-0-0.33-23
30-I totally agree.   But I think the original recommendation really hinted at seniority=payscale.   And while that is a very important part of unions, I just don't see where it works for programmers.  That's where I think unions could be more helpful to their people  it's not ALWAYS just about the wages, but unions generally start with wages.   I guess in most places, they are trying to make sure a living wage is earned, commensurate to the job, but in this case, the wages are one thing that shouldn't be considered  they're already high enough, and a unionized seniority=paygrade scale would be a disaster.-0.3129746-0.2222906-0.3315192-1-0-0.43-29

This led to a lot of resentment in people who didn't get the grant.The whole concept was horribly flawed.  The basic idea, as far as I can tell, was "our comp is significantly lower than competitors and we're losing our best people to them, so let's.......give them a onetime grant instead of fixing the actual annual compensation Delta?

55-Yeah, agreed. I'm personally a big web browser (engine) geek for whatever reason, I just happened to follow development on all major browsers for years upon years (to be honest, I started that just in 2012 or so, but I've been following code reviews and issue trackers on Chromium and Firefox, to a lesser extent WebKit also). On the 'closedsource' side (which partially applies to Vivaldi) I've been following Vivaldi and Opera development daily.Vivaldi is my absolute favorite browser featurewise. It used to be Opera (both Presto Opera and Chromium Opera when it released) before the Chinese buyout. Opera contributed a shit ton of code back to Chromium, keeping very minimal changes to themselves. Looks like either the upstreamtools tool has stopped working or Opera has stopped contributing to Chromium this summer, but I'm guessing it's the first option as that has happened before, but here's a nice webpage showing most of Opera's Chromium upstream contributions: https://operasoftware.github.io/upstreamtools/Unfortunately, even though I was a Vivaldi user starting from it's release up until this year, I made the decision to switch to Firefox. I'm very well aware of the fact that Firefox still doesn't offer performance levels that Chromiumbased browsers provide (although Firefox has been catching up in certain areas quite nicely lately, namely rendering performance because of the WebRender project, as well as style engine performance because of 'stylo', and they've made some nice SpiderMonkey improvements as well to speed up JS execution). Chromium's DOM and JS speed is still way better than what Firefox offers, but because of WebRender and the exciting evolution of that project i jumped ship to try and show a bit of support to them.Following browser engine development has been really interesting to me, there have been so many cool projects which required years upon years worth of manpower on all engines, when those projects reach completion it's nice to have seen the evolution.Some examples of nice engine level projects I've been following would be things like Oilpan implementation in Chromium (adding a modern GC for DOM objects, which before that were mostly refcounted and resulted in lots of bugs and crashes), where it was a multiyear project between mostly Google and Opera engineers. The solutions they came up with not to regress benchmarks, microbenchmarks, realworld sites, their testing methods, their rollout plans, all of the infrastructure work surrounding such a huge project (buildbots, perfbots, A/B testing on users etc.) were simply amazing to follow.Another example from Chromium would be the siteisolation project (which they managed to complete quite a bit before Firefox, their implementation is still lacking with web content not being sitespecific really), which was marvelous to watch as it touched so many developers who had to ensure their code worked with both siteisolated and not isolated versions of the browser.On the Firefox side, WebRender, Stylo and the whole Servo project is one obvious huge engineering feat that has been great to follow. E10s was also fun to follow, with it being a really long standing project as well.Most users probably have absolutely no idea how much work goes into maintaining / developing modern browsers. The amount of man hours that's gone into browser development may top off basically anything else. I guess operating system development follows with it, but that's quite a broad spectrum depending on how you define OS development. I think Linux alone might still get more contribution activity than Firefox or Chromium, but nonetheless all those projects are absolutely marvelous engineering feats, and it's simply a miracle the processes work as well as they do.-0.4608198-0.2850218-0.4838375-23-0-1-54

81-Unrelated to this specific project, it's really nice to see how .net Core has found its groove.It had a rocky start (project.json anyone?) and didn't seem to know what it wanted to be at first ("It's for crossplatform ASP.net Core!", "Ok, here's a Windows compat pack to support those features you all use!", "Ok, so we're making it a real crossplatform fully featured application framework, though some GUI features will have to wait!").But now, it's clear that the old .net Framework is legacy technology, as .net Core is getting more and more really awesome features that make it faster. And it has a much faster release cycle, along with the ability to create applications that don't need a systemwide framework to be installed. (Which also allows it to support [.NET Standard 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcingnetstandard21/), while NetFx 4.8 will be stuck on 2.0)Proper Span&lt;T&gt; support is arguably the biggest one (NetFx still has to deal with allocations), Utf8String, better SIMD support  really, almost no reason to start a new application project on NetFx, unless you're making a Windows GUI application.It's not all sunshine and roses, but as far as I am concerned, .NET Core is the best thing that happened to me in years, I get to work in the language I love (C#), in the web ecosystem of 2019 (that is, Linux and Containers).-0.3969692-0.2592129-0.3831782-40-0-1-1
82-&gt;I get to work in the language I love (C#), in the web ecosystem of 2019 (that is, Linux and Containers).My current organization is full of Java devs and Linux sysadmins, they were basically ready to end .net support altogether before .net core, but wow, not anymore.-0.2692991-0.2036789-0.2553489-12-0-0.4-81

84-If you think it's good in linux and on containers drink the koolaid and try a full azure setup.  You get a decent azure trial with a new account where you get about 23 weeks of solid dev playground.  And with MSDN your trial credits would probably last you 2 months if you aren't doing anything mega compute intensive.Azure is encroaching and probably taking over the premium cloud hosting space and for good reasons, IMO.  The only times it sucks is when you want to do something silly like render images using older .net framework code.  There's no standard drawing in .net core yet, but system.drawing is slated for future support!-0.2348509-0.2595332-0.3405544-3-0-0.6-81

110-A brass explosive spike and detonator key, apparently. &gt; This is a brass explosive spike and detonator key with hinged and folding spike and slotted end keys dating from the early 20th century. It is rather rare and was used to prepare explosives for the detonators to be inserted. The pin would pierce the explosive allowing a hole to be made ready for insertion of the detonator. It's made from solid brass and measures about 16cm long when closed and just under 25cm when opened.https://www.kimscuriosityshop.com/brassdemolitionexplosivedetonatorkeyandspike387p.aspFound this by searching for images of folding brass spikes.-0.3483498-0.2006105-0.3436942-19-0-0.8-1

If you were a girl, I would have probably already fucked the shit out of you by now, but unfortunately you are an ugly fucking GUY whose tight bussy will remained unstretched by my fat, meaty, nine inch cock because I AM NOT GAY. If I was gay though, you would find my Jackhammer pounding your tight little bussy with the force of ten tsunamis. Luckily for you, I am NOT GAY, and you will have your virgin asshole remain unpounded ad infinitum. Actually, it seems to me like you are the gay one here. You are gay, not me. I am not gay, and I will never be.

168-I'm not gay. I am not gay. Do not fucking call me gay ever again. I am quite honestly one of the least gay people you have ever met. I fuck bitches, mad fucking fucked bitches. I am not gay. I am not gay. Stop saying I am gay. If you were a girl, I would have probably already fucked the shit out of you by now, but unfortunately you are an ugly fucking GUY whose tight bussy will remained unstretched by my fat, meaty, nine inch cock because I AM NOT GAY. If I was gay though, you would find my Jackhammer pounding your tight little bussy with the force of ten tsunamis. Luckily for you, I am NOT GAY, and you will have your virgin asshole remain unpounded ad infinitum. Actually, it seems to me like you are the gay one here. You are gay, not me. I am not gay, and I will never be. If I was ever gay in a past life (which I WASN'T), I would be killing myself right now, that is how gay I AM NOT.*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

175-I’m massively 🌟turned on 💦by the thought 💨of punching 👊other women👭 in the stomach🤰. It started when I was around 15 1️⃣5️⃣ and never stopped🔚. My sister👧was the first1️⃣ person I actually did it to (long story). I’m 22 2️⃣2️⃣ now, and every time ⏲️I see a girl👩 with her stomach🤰 visible👀, I imagine 💭how she♀️’d react if she 🚺got punched👊 in it. I’ve provoked 🤯at least a half dozen girls👯 into physical fights💥, purely because I wanted to punch👊 them in their belly.It’s really easy 🤓 and I usually do it at music🎧 festivals 🎶and the like.

They don’t🙅 know 🧠that I’ve targeted 🎯them because they’re wearing a crop top/bikini 👙and I can see 👁️just how vulnerable🤺 their stomach🤰 is. I love💗 seeing the fear😱 and confusion😟 in their eyes👀 when they realize just how badly❌ I’m hurting them  most girls 👯have never been punched👊 in the stomach🤰before🔙 and have no idea 🤷how much it hurts☠️.I also realized 🤭that I could hang around the food stall 🍽️areas and pick 💁girls 👯who had just finished ✓eating🌯.

175-Could we also have a lightly enforced additional rule of be around to answer questions (and mark solved when appropriate)? It's so frustrating when people post something then disappear, when the top comments are people looking for scale/context/area/etc to actually help solve. Or when a poster links to a definitive answer, and OP can't be bothered enough to reply solved after getting a completely free, crowdsourced answer from a helpful community.-0.2455005-0.2519481-0.3173534-59-0-0.6-1
176-We're investigating ways to address both of these issues.   Impossible to force the hand of the OP, but maybe we can lessen occurrences of this somewhat.-0.3197471-0.2606108-0.2295113-23-0-0.4-175
177-Would it make sense to have a suggestion somewhere in there about reading the existing comments before posting your own? In so many threads, there's a super detailed topvoted answer followed by simpler top level posts of the same basic answer hours (or even days) later. I guess it's not that detrimental, but it does add to the noise and seems like karma grubbing a lot of the time.-0.380534-0.2423578-0.3018212-11-0-0.6-1
178-That would make sense.  However, if someone doesn't read the existing comments, there's little chance they're going to read any guidelines.  That can be incorporated though.-0.2093327-0.2376545-0.2339486-10-0-0.2-177
179-I'd imagine this has been brought up before, but is there a way to allow the community to mark as solved? I see a lot of posts that are clearly solved, but OP doesn't bother to mark them.Something similar to how r/murderedbywords does with their posts. -0.3088151-0.22461-0.2623543-9-0-0.2-1

198-I've always found it unbelievable that a SCOTUS Justice (lifetime appointment) only needs a majority in the Senate to be confirmed, especially when many bills that have much less of an impact on society require a super majority (60 votes).Also, it's worth noting that Kavanaugh was barely confirmed (50  48), whereas previous candidates have been confirmed far more easily.-0.2025192-0.2700048-0.2963752-1-0-0.6-1
199-Not always, it was Moscow Mitch that changed it."The nuclear option is a parliamentary procedure that allows the United States Senate to override the 60vote rule to close debate, by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the twothirds supermajority normally required to amend the rules. The option is invoked when the majority leader raises a point of order that only a simple majority is needed to close debate on certain matters. The presiding officer denies the point of order based on Senate rules, but the ruling of the chair is then appealed and overturned by majority vote, establishing new precedent.This procedure effectively allows the Senate to decide any issue by simple majority vote, regardless of existing procedural rules such as Rule XXII which requires the consent of 60 senators (out of 100) to end a filibuster for legislation, and 67 for amending a Senate rule. The term "nuclear option" is an analogy to nuclear weapons being the most extreme option in warfare.In November 2013, Senate Democrats led by Harry Reid used the nuclear option to eliminate the 60vote rule on executive branch nominations and federal judicial appointments, but not for the Supreme Court.[1] In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell extended the nuclear option to Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[2][3][4]As of September 2019, a threefifths majority vote is still required to end debates on legislation.[5]-0.4831173-0.2993039-0.3995367-1-0-1-198

292-SS: The European Union will create a new defence and space arm to help fund, develop and deploy armed forces, the bloc’s incoming chief executive said on Tuesday, naming an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron for the role.-0.3091519-0.2400107-0.2603059-68-0-0.6-1
293-Interesting to watch how the EU changes as Britain tries to leave it. Not that one causes the other. The article doesn’t go into too much detail. Is this a centralized standing EU army or just a series of agreements among the constituents to be able to mobilize quickly?-0.4327773-0.2352235-0.2776693-80-0-0.6-1
294-The second. It's about reinforcing military cooperation and integration between the member States, as with PESCO. A "centralized standing EU army" has been floated around as a distant idea, but nothing more. I don't think any country right now would accept such a thing, but maybe through these cooperation projects, when and if they are successful, we will start seeing real military integration.-0.2059551-0.2630042-0.3050534-69-0-0.8-293
295-&gt;A "centralized standing EU army" has been floated around as a distant idea, but nothing more.  The way to do this (cheaply and effectively) is to have a small but highly trained core of permanent force soldiers from the countries of the EU (money is lavished on them). When an EU force is required, troops are recruited from the EU countries and they are trained by the EU permanent force members in martial disciplines and EU military protocols. A reasonably trained troop can be deployed within 6 weeks with a consistent level of training and knowledge of EU logistics. Much cheaper than a huge standing army that has to be trained, equipped and is eating its head off.-0.3493861-0.278183-0.3471738-26-0-1-294
296-It's not really about the details of the arrangement, but simply that the current EU member States are not willing to agree to giving up their powers regarding defense and foreign policy, period. The EU can help coordinate or reach a common position, but it can never have a true, federal sovereignty over those areas above the member States. Like I say, the details of a EU army is not the important thing, but rather what it would say about the relationship between the States and the EU and the very nature of the EU (sovereignty, federal EU vs confederal EU, etc.).-0.4668133-0.2512482-0.3310556-38-0-0.8-295
297-This. It has nothing to do with their ability to do it, but rather the will to do it in a manner that actually gives the proposal some teeth.Sure they could sink a ton of time, effort and funds into it, but who would have the final say when push comes to shove? How would a decision be made that results in actually deploying said army? Or rather more importantly, will individual members have the ability to veto such a deployment if they so choose?-0.418724-0.2749203-0.3121359-16-0-0.6-296
298-You can make the point that states would not want to give up power, but wouldn’t they have more power as a unified military force. Many EU countries deploy troops in the same combat areas as other countries in the EU already. Also, EU military interests beyond Europe are generally similar. Couldn’t a larger unified coalition exert more power and more efficiently complete those goals?-0.2490332-0.2538072-0.3424577-0-0-0.4-296
299-its not really my expertise, which is why you should take what i say with a block of salt. if the EU were to implement an official unified armed force it shows the world its willingness and potential to exert military power on other countries. that stance would conflict with what the EU has always preached and tried to implement with a lot of other countries. that is to spread a peaceful message of "human rights above all, and global cooperation." the first surely is to be enforced with military presence if necessary.While thats already happening, there are differing opinions on its success. A unified military branch would in my opinion be able to act more efficient but it would have to be carefully implemented as to not scare away any countries that would view that as the first step to imperialism.im sure the EU would be far from imperialistic, but as long as there is no "real threat" to the EU its the image that counts.edit in regard to the member states unwillingness to give up military power: the EU is pretty diverse inside its borders. Here im not talking about ethnicity or culture but rather about what each country has to fight with. some are economically underdeveloped, infused with corruption, some are just way too small to have any real say and some are the great council of five that appear to rule the EU from the "shadows". what i want to say is that if the eu has a unified army it is to be implemented in regard to every member state and its dependence on their own military branch. members who depend on their military wont be forced to disband that force just because "why you need that? we have the eu armed forces". in the future we may rely on that kind of military unification but i think for the transition to be a success, its got to be far from radical.-0.5222466-0.2824067-0.4245821-11-0-1-298
300-The EEAS removed, in 2016, references to spreading human rights and democracy from the strategic planning papers. It's no longer EU policy to spread democracy, it was instead replaced with references to pragmatism.-0.2700126-0.2234607-0.2552423-4-0-0.6-299
301-something to note as well. shifting their higher moral goal to something more applicable is to me somewhat surprising (because of the "treacherous" attitude towards the constitution) but a pretty good move. it leads to more personal and adaptive diplomacy.-0.3352689-0.2371474-0.2778156-1-0-0.4-300
302-Yes, we could exert way more power if we acted together and united. Big part of why I am a European federalist. But that is the "rational" decision to make. The irrational decision to make (not uniting) relies more on nationalism and distrust towards the other member States. On a more factual basis, though, there is an actual divergence in the foreign and defense policies of the various member States, which is also a driver behind the reluctance to unify forces. Several countries are neutral (not members of NATO), others are very risk averse and/or have pacifist political traditions (notably Germany), while others are the opposite, favoring foreign interventions (France), or holding very hawky positions on external foes (Poland on Russia, for example). A untied Europe could much more easily achieve its objectives, but what those objectives would be is hard to see, given these splits.-0.3729616-0.2776054-0.3685153-5-0-0.8-298
303-&gt;Also, EU military interests beyond Europe are generally similar. Not really. France has interests in various regions in africa, Poland interests in eastern europe, Italy in Mediterranean. &amp;#x200B;You wouldnt see Poland agreeing to send in troops to defend Mali from a rebellion whereas France would. While it would be more effective to have a unified force, it isnt plausible unless we see some sort of ww3 type event occur which forces them to unify.-0.1907487-0.2690434-0.3130306-13-0-0.8-298

292-S.S: After a drones attacks on a Saudi Aramco oilfield, the government has decided to shut down half of its oil production, in a move that's going to affect 5% of the global oil production.The attack was claimed by the Houthi rebels based in Yemen and supported by Iran. This is not the first time attacks from Yemen have targeted the Saudi Kingdom, though it was much more successful, causing widespread damage and fires.The new development will likely increase the price of oil, leading to a worsening global economic downturn, aided by the USChina trade war. It will also increase tensions in the Gulf region, between Saudi Arabia and Iran that are locked in a power struggle in the Middle East.-0.4886388-0.2696073-0.3497539-195-0-0.8-1

The Saudis engaged in a short war already with the Houthis before.  MbS  emerged in 2015 a little known figure, with many other princes having already established their credentials as potential candidates for succession. This war IMO was waged, at least in large part, as an attempt to legitimate MbS assuming it would give him easy and quick military victory. MbS in an interview in early 2015, in his capacity as Minister of Defence, spoke of the war as something that would end in a matter of weeks at most. He seems to have thought genuinely that it would not last long and end in a decisive victory that would boost his image (which he has been working on since) as a rising great leader, it has backfired.Edit: Added a few sentences.-0.3886165-0.2831807-0.3861992-103-0-1-292

306-That is a very flawed reasoning. It’s not just about the oil price itself. Shutting down production like that has two massive negative implications on Saudi Arabia. Firstly they lose market share, which allows other countries to produce even more. Secondly Saudi oil production goes more expensive due to increasing cost of insurance.I’d also add a third problem: the already difficult IPO of Aramco just became more difficult.-0.2391077-0.2830778-0.3173648-1-0-0.8-305

336-There's two things to note here:1. The human body doesn't feel absolute temperature, what you feel is how much heat is entering (hot) or leaving (cold) your body (That's why metals always feel a lot hotter or colder than their surrounding, high heat conductivity). So in the case of your breath, the air comes out faster on the "Hoo" sound. A faster flow of air will carry more heat away from your hand via convection. As someone else pointed out, it is the same reason a fan cools you down even though the air doesn't get any colder. 2. The reason the "Hoo" sound produces a faster airflow than the "Haa" sound for the same effort has to do with the opening size in your throat. If your lungs are pushing the same amount of air in both instances, the air will have to come out faster if the opening is smaller. Think of a garden hose when partially block the opening with your thumb, the water comes out faster!-0.4702032-0.2640631-0.3609514-1-0-1--1

339-Hold on, that's not all there is.When you hoo, your mouth/lips act as a nozzle and accelerate air flow going out. With gasses (all fluids actually) when you increase their velocity, the pressure drops. And according to the laws of thermodynamics, when a gas's pressure is decreased it's temperature decreases too. If you take a pressurized container and suddenly release the gas out of a tube, the tube will get cold.Edit: The important thing here is the shape of your mouth and not how wide it is open as one person says. You can have the same opening at your lips but when you hoo, your cheeks go in and form a nozzle where there is a construction and then an opening. Constrictions accelerate the fluid.-0.4531472-0.2682372-0.347035-1-0-1-336
