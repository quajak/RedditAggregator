28-True, and good point.-0.03-0.03-0-1-0-0.03-27
29-There are a lot of ways to make a union work. No, it doesn't make sense to be like the B&amp;T unions in your city that pay strictly by years of seniority, but that's not the only way for unions to function. You could easily have a union that sets only minimum pay rules, or something more akin to any of the various licensure organizations that exist for other learned professions like lawyers, engineers, or accountants (which aren't "unions" but do many of the same things as unions, including regulating work hours and conditions).-0.33-0.33-0-1-0-0.33-23
30-I totally agree.   But I think the original recommendation really hinted at seniority=payscale.   And while that is a very important part of unions, I just don't see where it works for programmers.  That's where I think unions could be more helpful to their people  it's not ALWAYS just about the wages, but unions generally start with wages.   I guess in most places, they are trying to make sure a living wage is earned, commensurate to the job, but in this case, the wages are one thing that shouldn't be considered  they're already high enough, and a unionized seniority=paygrade scale would be a disaster.-0.43-0.43-0-1-0-0.43-29

This led to a lot of resentment in people who didn't get the grant.The whole concept was horribly flawed.  The basic idea, as far as I can tell, was "our comp is significantly lower than competitors and we're losing our best people to them, so let's.......give them a onetime grant instead of fixing the actual annual compensation Delta?

55-Yeah, agreed. I'm personally a big web browser (engine) geek for whatever reason, I just happened to follow development on all major browsers for years upon years (to be honest, I started that just in 2012 or so, but I've been following code reviews and issue trackers on Chromium and Firefox, to a lesser extent WebKit also). On the 'closedsource' side (which partially applies to Vivaldi) I've been following Vivaldi and Opera development daily.Vivaldi is my absolute favorite browser featurewise. It used to be Opera (both Presto Opera and Chromium Opera when it released) before the Chinese buyout. Opera contributed a shit ton of code back to Chromium, keeping very minimal changes to themselves. Looks like either the upstreamtools tool has stopped working or Opera has stopped contributing to Chromium this summer, but I'm guessing it's the first option as that has happened before, but here's a nice webpage showing most of Opera's Chromium upstream contributions: https://operasoftware.github.io/upstreamtools/Unfortunately, even though I was a Vivaldi user starting from it's release up until this year, I made the decision to switch to Firefox. I'm very well aware of the fact that Firefox still doesn't offer performance levels that Chromiumbased browsers provide (although Firefox has been catching up in certain areas quite nicely lately, namely rendering performance because of the WebRender project, as well as style engine performance because of 'stylo', and they've made some nice SpiderMonkey improvements as well to speed up JS execution). Chromium's DOM and JS speed is still way better than what Firefox offers, but because of WebRender and the exciting evolution of that project i jumped ship to try and show a bit of support to them.Following browser engine development has been really interesting to me, there have been so many cool projects which required years upon years worth of manpower on all engines, when those projects reach completion it's nice to have seen the evolution.Some examples of nice engine level projects I've been following would be things like Oilpan implementation in Chromium (adding a modern GC for DOM objects, which before that were mostly refcounted and resulted in lots of bugs and crashes), where it was a multiyear project between mostly Google and Opera engineers. The solutions they came up with not to regress benchmarks, microbenchmarks, realworld sites, their testing methods, their rollout plans, all of the infrastructure work surrounding such a huge project (buildbots, perfbots, A/B testing on users etc.) were simply amazing to follow.Another example from Chromium would be the siteisolation project (which they managed to complete quite a bit before Firefox, their implementation is still lacking with web content not being sitespecific really), which was marvelous to watch as it touched so many developers who had to ensure their code worked with both siteisolated and not isolated versions of the browser.On the Firefox side, WebRender, Stylo and the whole Servo project is one obvious huge engineering feat that has been great to follow. E10s was also fun to follow, with it being a really long standing project as well.Most users probably have absolutely no idea how much work goes into maintaining / developing modern browsers. The amount of man hours that's gone into browser development may top off basically anything else. I guess operating system development follows with it, but that's quite a broad spectrum depending on how you define OS development. I think Linux alone might still get more contribution activity than Firefox or Chromium, but nonetheless all those projects are absolutely marvelous engineering feats, and it's simply a miracle the processes work as well as they do.-1-1-0-23-0-1-54

A switch can be a big pain, so you need features that make your product better.I, for whatever reason, have always hated Google products, so I always avoided Chrome. I just sucked it up and used Edge until I realized Firefox was much better a year and a half ago or so.-0.4-0.4-0-211-0-0.4-73
81-Unrelated to this specific project, it's really nice to see how .net Core has found its groove.It had a rocky start (project.json anyone?) and didn't seem to know what it wanted to be at first ("It's for crossplatform ASP.net Core!", "Ok, here's a Windows compat pack to support those features you all use!", "Ok, so we're making it a real crossplatform fully featured application framework, though some GUI features will have to wait!").But now, it's clear that the old .net Framework is legacy technology, as .net Core is getting more and more really awesome features that make it faster. And it has a much faster release cycle, along with the ability to create applications that don't need a systemwide framework to be installed. (Which also allows it to support [.NET Standard 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcingnetstandard21/), while NetFx 4.8 will be stuck on 2.0)Proper Span&lt;T&gt; support is arguably the biggest one (NetFx still has to deal with allocations), Utf8String, better SIMD support  really, almost no reason to start a new application project on NetFx, unless you're making a Windows GUI application.It's not all sunshine and roses, but as far as I am concerned, .NET Core is the best thing that happened to me in years, I get to work in the language I love (C#), in the web ecosystem of 2019 (that is, Linux and Containers).-0.5-0.5-0-40-0-1-1
82-&gt;I get to work in the language I love (C#), in the web ecosystem of 2019 (that is, Linux and Containers).My current organization is full of Java devs and Linux sysadmins, they were basically ready to end .net support altogether before .net core, but wow, not anymore.-0.5-0.5-0-12-0-0.4-81
83-MS is going to be releasing .net 5 in 2021...it's going to be the one and only .net at that point. And it's cross platform. No more .net framework/core/standard-0.5-0.5-0-10-0-0.6-82
84-If you think it's good in linux and on containers drink the koolaid and try a full azure setup.  You get a decent azure trial with a new account where you get about 23 weeks of solid dev playground.  And with MSDN your trial credits would probably last you 2 months if you aren't doing anything mega compute intensive.Azure is encroaching and probably taking over the premium cloud hosting space and for good reasons, IMO.  The only times it sucks is when you want to do something silly like render images using older .net framework code.  There's no standard drawing in .net core yet, but system.drawing is slated for future support!-0.5-0.5-0-3-0-0.6-81
85-Oh yeah, running a full on Azurehosted setup for work and love it. But the thing about Containers is that they can be spun up outside of Azure as well, which is useful in cases where the cloud isn't an option, or where someone desires a "second source" provider like AWS.As for drawing, [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) is currently the most promising option.-0.5-0.5-0-2-0-0-84

285-While I certainly do not support the horrendous, immoral actions of this administration on our southern border, to use the word "disappeared" is both disrespectful and inaccurate. It attempts to draw parallels with some of the worst atrocities carried out in the western hemisphere. Undeniably these actions are wrong, but this isn't [Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augusto_Pinochet&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop#Suppression_of_opposition) or [Operation Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor) or [The Dirty War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War). People aren't being gathered up by Ford Falcons from their home, being flown out over the ocean in a helicopter, being eviscerated (to prevent their bodies from floating up) and kicked out. All of this was supported by our (the US) government, but not this one.Words matter. This shit is unethical, but it's not that.-0.290459-0.356886-0-1-0-1-1
287-Unpopular opinion: Why rejecting illegal immigrant is not an option?

110-A brass explosive spike and detonator key, apparently. &gt; This is a brass explosive spike and detonator key with hinged and folding spike and slotted end keys dating from the early 20th century. It is rather rare and was used to prepare explosives for the detonators to be inserted. The pin would pierce the explosive allowing a hole to be made ready for insertion of the detonator. It's made from solid brass and measures about 16cm long when closed and just under 25cm when opened.https://www.kimscuriosityshop.com/brassdemolitionexplosivedetonatorkeyandspike387p.aspFound this by searching for images of folding brass spikes.-0.3019193-0.4258181-0-19-0-0.8-1
