0.1 - If you don't cough it all out, does the water just sit there? - 1
0.25 - generally you should be able to cough it all out barring various brain and body problems but the water should go away if it's a tiny enough amount. problem is, even if the water is absolutely sterile, the routes it can take have bacteria (nose, mouth), so you might end up with a lung infection, coughing, extra mucus production, problems breathing, etc depending on how bad it is. - 1
0.35 - It is possible. It's called "aspiration." What happens then is that fluid can sit and pool in your lungs. Which isnt good for your lungs. Pneumonia can happen or other respiratory dysfunctions. This is actually common in (older) adults that has lost some ability to swallow properly. This is why you will see some people on thickened liquids and pureed food to be able to eat. It's easier to swallow properly. Food can also go into your lungs as well. Aspiration in general can prove to be fatal. If I recall correctly, it's why you want to watch drowning victims for "dry drowning." They inhaled fluid into their lungs and that's what killed them.  - 1
0.5 - ## Dry drowning[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drowning&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23)]  Dry drowning is a term that has never had an accepted medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note Hawkins_EMN_2017 56)[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 57) Following the 2002 World Congress on Drowning in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of drowning was established. Based on this definition, drowning is the "process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid."[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note Drowning_2006 58) This definition resulted in only three legitimate drowning subsets: fatal drowning, non fatal drowning with illness/injury, and non fatal drowning without illness/injury.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 59)In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication use of the term "dry drowning".[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note Hawkins_EMN_2017 56) Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation,[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note ILCOR_2003 60)the Wilderness Medical Society,[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 61) the American Heart Association,[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 62) the Utstein Style system,[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note ILCOR_2003 60) the International Lifesaving Federation,[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 63) the International Conference on Drowning,[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note Drowning_2006 58) Starfish Aquatics Institute,[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 64) the [American Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross),[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 65) the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) (CDC),[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 66)[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 67)[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 68) the [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) [\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 69) and the [American College of Emergency Physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Emergency_Physicians).[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 70)  Drowning experts have recognized that the end result pathophysiology of hypoxemia, acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis, but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is generally established that pathophysiological discussions of "dry" versus "wet" drowning are not relevant to drowning care.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 71)  "Dry drowning" is frequently cited in the news with a wide variety of definitions.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note ACEP2017 72) and is often confused with the equally inappropriate and discredited term "secondary drowning" or "delayed drowning".[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note 73) Various conditions including spontaneous pneumothorax, chemical pneumonitis, bacterial or viral pneumonia, head injury, asthma, heart attack, and chest trauma have been misattributed to the erroneous terms "delayed drowning", "secondary drowning", and "dry drowning". Currently, there has never been a case identified in the medical literature where a person was observed to be without symptoms and who died hours or days later as a direct result of drowning alone.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note Hawkins_EMN_2017 56)  &amp;#x200B;  So I'm not real clear what "dry drowning is. Can you explain that another way please? I posted from the Wiki article to show that I DID Google it and failed to understand...not to "show you up." - 1
0.3 - You start drowning and inhale some water while panicking, and the water goes into your lungs. The lifeguards pull you out, and you’re ok. However, the water is still in your lungs. This damages your lungs, and causes them to not work well. Within a few hours, you start coughing and having trouble breathing. No one around you knows what to do because it’s been hours and the drowning incident is probably forgotten (or they didn’t see/you were too embarrassed to tell). You start to suffocate as your body can’t get enough oxygen and rid itself of CO2, and you end up dying. That’s basically the gist of it.  - 1
0.1 - Basically how you die from Alzheimer's, you forget how to swallow, and get aspiration pneumonia. - 1
0.1 - Alzheimer's eats your brain. Dysphagia is a side effect of that.  - 1
0.1 - Alzheimer's eats your brain. Dysphagia is a side effect of that.  - 1
0.1 - Correct, but the thing that actually kills you is the aspiration pneumonia (or alternatively kidney disease). - 1
0.2 - If it happens as that reason. I know pneumonia is a likely killer in general, but JUST aspiration pneumonia? Seems unlikely. I could be wrong, it just seems unlikely that every Alzheimer's death is related to aspiration pneumonia.   (If this posts more than once, I apologize. I keep getting a something went wrong notification) - 1
0.15 - I dunno, about six months before, the hospice nurses told us that Gampy would choke on some food and die from pneumonia about Christmas time. He died the first week in January.     (Reddit is buggy this morning, I have had the same problem) - 1
0.15 - &gt;"dry drowning."   Could you explain  "dry drowning."  in another way \[lease? I understand aspiration. Is it just fluids produced by the lungs in response to being irritated by the water from the aspiration event? - 1
0.25 - Kind of. Irritation and inflammation of the lungs.  - 1
0.3 - Aspiration pneumonia, caused by inhaling food/drink, is actually the way that Alzheimer's disease eventually kills you. Your brain unravels to the point where you are unable to swallow, and eventually you aspirate, or inhale some food, and it winds up in your lungs, where it doesn't belong, causing an infection.  - 1
0.1 - Was pretty sure that honor was reserved for JavaScript. - 1
0.25 - [Github repo market share](https://githut.info/) reflects that JS is the most **currently used**, but Python probably has the fastest growth (which is a claim that the title more closely implies, and search data would better support). - 1
0.22 - Going from 1% to 2% is 100% growth. Relative growth is probably one of the least significant things to measure. - 1
0.05 - https://xkcd.com/1102/ - 1
0.25 - I would interpret search traffic to indicate growth on an absolute basis of a number of new users, not relative percentage growth.  But to what end is that not significant to? **The title/article chiefly discusses growth,** not current market share. I wanted to make sure everyone understood the distinction, because the title is somewhat ambiguous if you don't read it carefully, or if you don't read the article. - 1
0.3 - And if Python were only a tiny portion of repositories, that would be a relevant argument to make. However, it's already the third most common language on GitHub with about has as many repos as JavaScript, so relative growth is a good measure. - 1
0.05 - I cant see any data after 2014 `? - 1
0.4 - Sorry, I didn't notice that. [Here's another that's been updated](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2018/3). By this data, Python actually declined '14 '17. Github repo data definitely has its own biases though. - 1
0.2 - Just about all these growth analyzers have massive biases in one way or another.  - 1
0.06 - I know its really hard to spot. Its a very nice site though and i wish that they would updated it. Thanks for the new link btw. - 1
0.2 - Does this include the LOC of source that are vendored into various packages etc.?  - 1
0.25 - Probably not; node_modules is meant to be kept out of source control. - 1
0.35 - GitHub is a relatively small share of all the code written though and it's skewed towards certain type of projects. I wouldn't be surprised if Java still dwarfs any other language when counting enterprise software. - 1
0.2 - Problem is no one searches for "javascript". Everyone is looking for "angular", "vue", "react", "jquery" etc. It's not the case with python.  - 1
0.2 - I suspect javascript is certainly the most used language, but I doubt that its the most admired - 1
0.2 - I don't know, since es6 it's not that bad - 1
0.25 - Yeah, but how many enterprise projects are on ES6? I *wish* we had arrow notation and string templates.  - 1
0.2 - Now you're moving the goalpost. Just because many projects are currently stuck with an older version doesn't mean that the language itself hasn't improved. - 1
0.35 - on the other hand, it's kind of misleading to say that a language is better if no one uses any of the features that make it better, but are stuck dealing with shims and lingering compatibility issues - 1
0.2 - Babel (or better yet, Typescript) works well and is backward compatible (unlike Python 3  &gt; 2). Something to consider, at least. - 1
0.1 - Or VBA + Excel sheets to store data - 1
